## Project summary
Sky Eye is a flight tracking application designed to provide users with real-time
information about flights and airport activities. The users will be able to see an overview
of all current flights presented on a world map + a list with all big airports and aircraft types. What sets Sky Eye apart is its innovative
Augmented Reality (AR) feature that allows users to identify airplanes in the air with their
camera.

### Room database
We have a database that currently stores 2 things:
- User login information:\
![Account Settings](ReadmeImages/accountsettingsscreen.png)
- Appearance settings:\
![Appearance in settings darkmode enabled](ReadmeImages/appearancesettingsscreendarkmode.png)

### API request
We use an API to retrieve airport details: \
![Airport detail](ReadmeImages/airportdetailscreen.png)

### Intents
1. Support email: On the support page, clicking the email address opens the email app.\
![Open email app intent](ReadmeImages/intent-gmail.png)
2. Maps: On an airport page users can click a button to show the airport on their map app.\
![Open google maps app intent](ReadmeImages/intent-googlemaps.png)

### Workmanager
If the app has not been opened for 2 days, the workmanager will send a push notification to increase user engagement.
![notifications uses workmanager](ReadmeImages/notification.png)

### Notifications
If the app has not been opened for 2 days, the workmanager will send a push notification to increase user engagement.\
![notification ui](ReadmeImages/notification.png)

### Canvas and animations
Canvas is used to show airport markers on the map.\
![Canvas to render markers](ReadmeImages/canvas-markers.png)

### Sensor data
Optional: not implemented.

### Camera
When a user wants to know what an airplane in the sky is, they can use the built-in camera AR feature.\
